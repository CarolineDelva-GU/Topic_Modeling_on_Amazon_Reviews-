# Data

- UCSD Amazon Reviews 2023  
- All Beauty subset  
  - 632K users  
  - 112K items  
  - 701K ratings  
- Raw json files streamed, decompressed, and stored in S3  

---

# Data Cleaning

- Cleaned reviewText, summary, and title fields 
- Lowercased text, removed URLs, usernames, punctuation, extra white space, and non ASCII characters

---

# NER Redaction

- spaCy `en_core_web_sm` named entity detection  
- Replace people, organizations, locations with tags  
  - `[PERSON]`, `[ORG]`, `[LOCATION]`  

  
---

# Text Preprocessing

- Keep alphabetic tokens with length at least three  
- Remove extended stopword list  
  - scikit learn English  
  - NLTK stopwords  
  - HTML artifacts  
  - Specific words such as “great” and “product”  

---

# Count Vectorization

- Unigrams and bigrams  
- At most 40K features  
- Frequency filters: `min_df=20`, `max_df=0.5`  

---

# TFIDF Vectorization

- Same text stream, token pattern, and stopwords as count model  
- TFIDF weights instead of raw counts  

---

# Sentence Embeddings

- SentenceTransformer model such as `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`  
- Batch encoding into dense embeddings  
- Save `embeddings.npy` under `amazon_vectors/embeddings/` in S3  

---

# LDA

- Load count vectors and vocab from S3  
- Train ten topic LDA model in scikit learn  
- Extract top words per topic and build word clouds  
- Store outputs under `data/lda_results`  

---

# LSA

- Load TFIDF vectors and vocab from S3  
- Fit ten topic Truncated SVD model with Normalizer  
- Extract top terms per component  
- Save results and plots under `data/lsa_results`  

---

# BERTopic

- Use SentenceTransformer embeddings as input  
- Dimensionality reduction with UMAP  
- Cluster documents with HDBSCAN  
- Extract topics with c TFIDF and refine topic labels  
- Store topic assignments and probabilities for each review  

---

# LDA Topics (Example)

- Topic 0: hair, iron, clips, flat, dryer, spray  
  - Heat styling and hold  
- Topic 7: oil, scent, skin, cream, beard, fragrance  
  - Oils and fragrance  
- Topic 8: skin, face, mask, serum, moisturizer  
  - Skin treatment and hydration  

---

# LSA Topics (Example)

- Topic 1: curly hair, clips, hold, shampoo, conditioner  
  - Curly hair care  
- Topic 2: dry skin, cream, sensitive, serum, mask  
  - Sensitive skin care  
- Topic 4: color, polish, nails, pink, dark, light  
  - Color cosmetic items  

---

# BERTopic Topics (Example)

- Topic A: “curl cream”, “leave in”, “frizz”, “wave”  
  - Curl defining products  
- Topic B: “retinol”, “serum”, “fine lines”, “texture”  
  - Anti aging skin care  
- Topic C: “press on”, “gel polish”, “chip”, “manicure”  
  - Nail products
